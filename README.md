# PLACEHOLDER SCRAPER

This is a scraper that runs on [Morph](https://morph.io). To get started [see the documentation](https://morph.io/documentation)

This is a placeholder whilst we get around to creating a new scraper.
Using a placeholder allows us to see the past history,
as opposed to clearing the scraper entry in PlanningAlerts
